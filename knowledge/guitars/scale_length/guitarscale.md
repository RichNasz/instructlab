Guitar scale length refers to the distance between the nut (the point between the neck and headstock where the strings start) and the bridge (the point where the strings anchor to the body). This measurement typically ranges from around 24 inches to 26.5 inches, with variations in between.

To measure the scale length of a guitar, you can use the following steps. Step one is to measure the distance from the front edge of the nut to the center of the 12th fret. Step two is to double the measurement from step one.

While thereâ€™s no one scale length that we can call the universal standard, different electric guitar manufactures tend to settle on standard lengths for their guitars.

Scale length can impact guitar design and playability in a variety of ways.

Multi-scale guitars are one of the greatest innovations in the guitar industry, though that's not to say multi-scale instruments are modern. In fact, they have been around for centuries, and many classical instruments incoporate multiple scales in their design. For example, the piano and harp have strings of varying lengths for the exact same reasons as multi-scale guitars.
