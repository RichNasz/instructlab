# What is RHEL AI?
Red Hat Enterprise Linux AI (RHEL AI), a foundation model platform to seamlessly develop, test and run best-of-breed, open source Granite generative AI models to power enterprise applications. RHEL AI is based on the InstructLab open source project and combines open source-licensed Granite large language models from IBM Research and InstructLab model alignment tools, based on the LAB (Large-scale Alignment for chatBots) methodology, in an optimized, bootable RHEL image to simplify server deployments.

# What is included with RHEL AI?
RHEL AI includes the following items
* Granite family models - Open source-licensed LLMs, distributed under the Apache-2.0 license, with complete transparency on training datasets
* InstructLab model alignment tools - Scalable, cost-effective solution for enhancing LLM capabilities and making AI model development open and accessible to all users.
* Optimized bootable model runtime instances - Granite models & InstructLab tooling packaged as a bootable RHEL image, including Pytorch/runtime libraries and hardware optimization (NVIDIA, Intel and AMD).
* Enterprise support, lifecycle & indemnification - Trusted enterprise platform, 24x7 production support, extended model lifecycle and model IP indemnification by Red Hat.
