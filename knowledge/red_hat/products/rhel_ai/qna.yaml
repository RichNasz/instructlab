  - context: |
      Guitar scale length refers to the distance between the nut (the point between the neck and headstock where the
      strings start) and the bridge (the point where the strings anchor to the body). This measurement typically
      ranges from around 24 inches to 26.5 inches, with variations in between.

      - question: |
          What is the scale length of a guitar?
        answer: |
          Scale length refers to the distance between the nut (the point between the neck and headstock where the
          strings start) and the bridge (the point where the strings anchor to the body).
      - question: |
          What are popular scale lengths for electric guitars?
        answer: |
          Scale length on electric guitars typically range from 24 inches to 26.5 inches.
      - question: |
          Are scale lengths calculated differently for accoustic and electric guitars?
        answer: |
          The calculation of scale length is the same for acoustic and electric guitars.
  - context: |
       To measure the scale length of a guitar, you can use the following steps. Step one is to measure the
       distance from the front edge of the nut to the center of the 12th fret. Step two is to double the measurement
       from step one.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How do I properly measure the scale length of a guitar?
        answer: |
          Measure the distance from the front edge of the nut to the center of the 12th fret, and then double
          that measurement.
      - question: |
          Can I determine guitar scale simply by measuring from the front edge of the nut to the bridge?
        answer: |
          This is not recommended as bridges may not be installed parallel to the nut, and with electric guitars
          intonation adjustments would impact the accuracy of the measurement.
      - question: |
          Is scale length measures in inches or millimeters?
        answer: |
          Scale length can be measured in either inches or millimeters. Measuring in inches is most common, but
          measurements in millimeters are gaining popularity for increased accuracy.
  - context: |
       While thereâ€™s no one scale length that we can call the universal standard, different electric guitar
       manufactures tend to settle on standard lengths for their guitars.

        answer: |
          Gretch has standardized on 24.6 inch scale lengths for the majoirty of their guitars.
  - context: |
       Scale length can impact guitar design and playability in a variety of ways.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Does scale length affect fret spacing?
        answer: |
          Yes! The distance between frets is calculated based on scale length.
      - question: |
          Does scale lenght affect string tension?
        answer: |
          Yes! The shorter the scale length is, the less tension that is on each string.
      - question: |
          Does scale length affect intonation?
        answer: |
          Yes! As a string becomes more taught it loses its flexibility, and in turn, this leads to less accurate
          intonation.
      - question: |
          Does scale length affect tone?
        answer: |
          Yes! Scale length determines the points at which string harmonics and overtones occur, and as a result,
          dictates the tone of your guitar.
  - context: |
       Multi-scale guitars are one of the greatest innovations in the guitar industry, though that's not to say
       multi-scale instruments are modern. In fact, they have been around for centuries, and many classical
       instruments incoporate multiple scales in their design. For example, the piano and harp have strings of
       varying lengths for the exact same reasons as multi-scale guitars.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Can you have a guitar with mutiple scale lengths?
        answer: |
          Yes! Such a guitar is refered to as a muli-scale guitar, and it is concept that has been around for
          centuries.
      - question: |
          Can you recognize the difference between a set scale length and a multi-scale length guitar?
        answer: |
          Yes! A gixed scale guitar will have frets that are paralled to the nut and bridge. Mult-scale guitars
          will have a fanned look which means mant frets will get an agle relative to the nut and bridge which
          impacts the distance between frets.
      - question: |
          Are multi-scale guitars harder to play?
        answer: |
          Maybe! for many the fan shape of the frets makes playing more comfortable at the wrist. For others, the
          fanned frets is a disraction they can't get past.
      - question: |
          On a mult-scale guitar does the vertical fret always need to be the same?
        answer: |
          No! For those who play equal parts rhythm and lead, you probably don't want aggressive fret angles on either
          end of the fretboard. For such players, a vertical 8th fret is common. However, if you are like most
          guitarists and play mostly rhythm on your 7 or 8-string, then you might prefer the vertical fret closer to
          the nut. That way, you don't sacrifice the ease of bar chords across the lower frets.
